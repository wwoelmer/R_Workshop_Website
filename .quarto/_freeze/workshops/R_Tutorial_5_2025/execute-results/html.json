We will use water quality data as an example, but these analyses can be applied to many other datasets, provided the statistical assumptions are met. We will cover the following topics:\n\n- Correlation analyses (Pearson and Spearman) and plots\n- Linear regression and plots\n- T-tests and Wilcoxon rank sum test (aka Mann-Whitney)\n- ANOVA\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis lesson teaches the implementation of multiple statistical analyses, rather than the background behind why, when, and what to check when choosing a statistical analysis. You should always check the underlying assumptions of an analysis and whether your data meet those assumptions.\n:::\n\nWe are adding a few new packages today which perform specialized functions for statistical analyses. You don't need to worry about the new packages too much, other than you will need to install and load the libraries.\n\nThe main packages that we will use in this tutorial are:\n\n- **tidyverse**\n- **lubridate**\n- **Hmisc**\n- **corrplot**\n- **ggpmisc**\n- **ggpubr**\n\nBefore attempting to install these packages, make sure your Primary CRAN Repository is set to:\n\n  * __\"New Zealand [https] - University of Auckland\"__  \n  \nTo check this, click 'Tools' --> 'Global Options' --> 'Packages'.  Click 'Change' if you need to adjust this.\n\nYou can download most packages by clicking on  the 'Install' button on the 'packages' tab in the lower right window pane.  Then in the Install Packages popup, select ‘Repository (CRAN)’ from the ‘Install from’ drop box and type the name of the package you wish to download (e.g., dplyr). \n\n\nOnce all of these packages are installed you can load them using the `library` function:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(Hmisc)\nlibrary(corrplot)\nlibrary(ggpmisc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'ggpmisc' was built under R version 4.4.3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'ggpp' was built under R version 4.4.3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFirst we will load in our data. We will use the same water quality data from Lesson 3. This data has been downloaded from Aquarius using the R script which you can find at `scripts/download_data_aquarius.R` if you'd like to see how the data were downloaded. For today, we are skipping that step and reading in directly from a .csv file which was written after the Aquarius download.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwq <- read.csv('./data/Lake_WQ_Timeseries.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, look at the `wq` dataframe by clicking on it in the environment and familiarise yourself with the columns. You can also run the function `colnames(wq)` in the console to get a list of column names. It's better to run this in the console (rather than in your script editor), since it is a diagnostic test and not something you will necessary need to run every time you open your script--just as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolnames(wq) # you don't have to save this in your script, but can copy it into the console\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"Site\"                \"LocationName\"        \"Time\"               \n [4] \"Value\"               \"Quality\"             \"Approval\"           \n [7] \"Qualifiers\"          \"Parameter\"           \"Unit\"               \n[10] \"Sample_Number\"       \"Project_Id\"          \"LowerDetectionLimit\"\n[13] \"UpperDetectionLimit\" \"Method\"              \"CollectionMethod\"   \n[16] \"Lab\"                 \"Error\"               \"Comment\"            \n[19] \"ACTION\"              \"Samp_Comment\"        \"Cloud_Cover\"        \n[22] \"Num_Swimmers\"        \"Tide_Cycle\"          \"Tide\"               \n[25] \"Wind_Direction\"      \"Wind_Speed\"          \"Weather_Today\"      \n[28] \"Weather_Yest\"        \"Surface_Cond\"        \"Bore_Type\"          \n[31] \"Bore_Number\"         \"Bore_Collect_Method\" \"Bore_Sampled_From\"  \n[34] \"Bore_Pump_Rate\"      \"Bore_Pump_Duration\"  \"Bore_Protocol\"      \n[37] \"Bore_Probe\"          \"Odour\"              \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAs we know from previous lessons, it is always best practice is to format date/time objects with the appropriate timezone, otherwise R will assume a timezone, and that can lead to the wrong date being set for your timestamp. This is the first thing I do when I see I have a datetime object as a column. Let's use a bit of code that will parse our `Time` column, which includes both a date and a time. \n\nHere, we will use a function called `parse_date_time` which looks at the `Time` column, and then provides a list (using `c()`) of potential formats that the column will be in. Here, we list two formats, the first one has YMD and HMS (hours, minutes, seconds), the second one just has YMD, as some of the values in the `Time` column don't have an associated time next to the date. We pair this with the `mutate` function to re-write our `Time` column.\n\nNOTE: there are many ways to format/parse dates and times in R. This is just one example!\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwq <- wq %>% mutate(Time = parse_date_time(Time,c(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\",\"%Y-%m-%d\"), tz = \"etc/GMT+12\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n___\n***Challenge 1:*** *What locations and parameters are included in this dataset?

We will filter the data to only select \"Lake Okaro at Site 1 (Integrated)\" and we will create a new dataframe named `wq_okaro` so we keep all the other lake data in the `wq` dataframe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwq_okaro <- wq %>% \n  filter(LocationName=='Lake Okaro at Site 1 (Integrated)')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's also clean up the dataframe and only select the columns which are useful to us right now\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwq_okaro <- wq_okaro %>% \n  select(Time, Value, Parameter, Unit)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's plot the data to make sure everything looks good. I like to do a `geom_point` plot, as well as a histogram, using `geom_histogram`\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(wq_okaro, aes(x = as.POSIXct(Time), y = Value, color = Parameter)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~Parameter, scales = 'free') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab('Time')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](R_Tutorial_5_2025_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(wq_okaro, aes(x = Value, fill = Parameter)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap(~Parameter, scales = 'free') +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](R_Tutorial_5_2025_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, we have a time series of four variables. There are many things we can do to analyse this data. Let's start with a correlation analysis.\n\n# Correlation analysis and plots\n\nA correlation analysis is used to assess the magnitude and direction of the relationship between two variables. It does not necessarily imply casuation, but shows you how two variables change together. \n\nWe will use the function `rcorr` and `corrplot` to create and visualize our correlation analysis. In order to conduct a correlation analysis, we need to do some formatting/rearranging. First, we need to make the data wide, but we also have to create a `Date` column which doesn't include\nthe time so that it is common across the variables. We will also remove the `Unit` column for this reason\n(and we don't need that column for this anyway since the units are stored in the Parameter names)\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nokaro_wide <- wq_okaro %>% \n  mutate(Date = as.Date(Time)) %>% \n  select(-Time, -Unit) %>% \n  group_by(Date, Parameter) %>% \n  summarise(Value = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = 'Parameter', values_from = 'Value') %>% \n  ungroup()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen up your new `okaro_wide` data and check it out. Those column names have gaps and symbols in them, which might cause us problems later. Let's rename the columns using the function `rename`. I'll show you one example\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nokaro_wide <- okaro_wide %>% \n  rename('chla_mgm3' = \"CHLA (mg/m^3)\") # the format is new name = old name\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n___\n***Challenge 2:*** *Rename the remaining variable columns to TN_gm3, TP_gm3, and secchi_m.*\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to see a solution</summary>\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nokaro_wide <- okaro_wide %>%\n    rename(TN_gm3 = \"TN (g/m^3)\", TP_gm3 = \"TP (g/m^3)\", secchi_m = \"VC - SD (m)\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n___\n\nGreat, your `okaro_wide` dataframe should now have the columns `Date`, `chla_mgm3`, `TN_gm3`, `TP_gm3`, and `secchi_m.`\n\nThe next thing we need to do in order to run the correlation analysis is to remove the `Date` column. We aren't interested in how date is correlated with chl-a, TN, TP, or secchi (for this analysis!). Just how they are correlated with each other.\n\n\n___\n***Challenge 3:*** *Use the `select` function to remove the Date column. Make this a new dataframe called `okaro_corr`.*\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to see a solution</summary>\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nokaro_corr <- okaro_wide %>%\n    select(-Date)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n___\n\nNow we have to make sure there are no NA's in the data frame, and format it as a matrix. This is simply because the function which runs the correlation analysis, `rcorr`, is picky, so we have to make it happy :) `rcorr` requires the format of the input to be a matrix, which is a two-dimensional data structure that organizes elements into rows and columns. This is slightly different from a dataframe, which is what we usually use, in that each element in a matrix must be of the same data type, making it a homogenous structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nokaro_corr <- na.omit(okaro_corr)\n# note that the function complete.cases() also will do the same trick here\nokaro_corr <- as.matrix(okaro_corr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let's run the correlation analysis using the `rcorr` function. The default type of analysis is Pearson, which assumes normality. Here, we will specify Spearman because our data are not all normally distributed (as we learned in our histogram plot earlier).\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nokaro_corr_out <- rcorr(okaro_corr, type = \"spearman\")\nprint(okaro_corr_out)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          chla_mgm3 TN_gm3 TP_gm3 secchi_m\nchla_mgm3      1.00   0.69   0.54    -0.75\nTN_gm3         0.69   1.00   0.72    -0.65\nTP_gm3         0.54   0.72   1.00    -0.46\nsecchi_m      -0.75  -0.65  -0.46     1.00\n\nn= 91 \n\n\nP\n          chla_mgm3 TN_gm3 TP_gm3 secchi_m\nchla_mgm3            0      0      0      \nTN_gm3     0                0      0      \nTP_gm3     0         0             0      \nsecchi_m   0         0      0             \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLet's look at that output!

You can check them out by googling `corrplot` and seeing what others have done and running `?corrplot` in the console to see what some of the different arguments do. Let's say we want to actually see what the correlation coefficients are on the plot.\n\n___\n***Challenge 4:*** *Remake the plot but add the argument `addCoef.col = \"black\"` to display the p-values within each circle.*\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to see a solution</summary>\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncorrplot(okaro_corr_out$r, \n         type = 'upper',\n         sig.level = 0.05, \n         addCoef.col = \"black\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         insig = 'blank', \n         p.mat = p_mat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](R_Tutorial_5_2025_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n___\n\n\n\n___\n***Challenge 3:*** *Repeat the correlation analysis for Lake Tarawera. How do the correlations compare between the two lakes? Remember, you need to first subset the `wq` dataframe for Lake Tarawera, then `pivot_wider` so your columns are your variables, `rename` your columns to get rid of symbols and spaces, remove the `Date` column and any NA's, then run your correlation using `rcorr`, and then plot your output using `corrplot`!*\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to see a solution</summary>\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwq_tara <- wq %>% \n  filter(LocationName=='Lake Tarawera at Site 5 (Integrated)') %>% \n  select(Time, Value, Parameter, Unit)\n\ntara_wide <- wq_tara %>% \n  mutate(Date = as.Date(Time)) %>% # keeping these lines in our workflow to remove Time and Unit\n  select(-Time, -Unit) %>% \n  group_by(Date, Parameter) %>% \n  summarise(Value = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = 'Parameter', values_from = 'Value')\n\ntara_wide <- tara_wide %>% \n  rename('chla_mgm3' = \"CHLA (mg/m^3)\",\n         'TN_gm3' = \"TN (g/m^3)\",\n         \"TP_gm3\" = \"TP (g/m^3)\",\n         \"secchi_m\" = \"VC - SD (m)\") %>% \n ungroup() %>% \n select(-Date)\n\ntara_corr <- na.omit(tara_wide)\ntara_corr_out <- rcorr(as.matrix(tara_corr), type = 'spearman')\n\np_mat <- tara_corr_out$P # this is the matrix of p_values\ndiag(p_mat) <- 1 # because there are no p-values on the diagonals, we have to insert 1 here for the plot to \ncorrplot(tara_corr_out$r, \n         type = 'upper',\n         diag = FALSE,\n         sig.level = 0.05, \n         insig = 'blank', \n         addCoef.col = 'black',\n         p.mat = p_mat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](R_Tutorial_5_2025_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n___\n\nBetween Lakes Okaro and Tarawera, we can now see that there are differences in both the strength of correlations, and in what correlations are significant. For example, in Lake Okaro, all the variables show significant correlations, with the strongest relationship between Secchi depth and chl-a (-0.75). In contrast, in Lake Tarawera, only chl-a and TN; TN and secchi; and chl-a and TN are significantly related, and the relationships are much weaker. There are lots of reasons we can dig into here, but a big driver of these different relationships is likely tied to differences in size, trophic state, and catchment characteristics!\n\n# Linear regression\n\nNext, we will conduct linear regression between two variables which we think are causally related. \n\nBased on our correlation plots above, let's do this for chl-a and TN in Lake Okaro which have a strong, positive correlation. We will go back to our `okaro_wide` dataframe for this, which we created earlier. We will use the function `lm()` to conduct linear regression. Then, we use `summary()` to shows us the results of the model. We can also run `plot(model)` to show the residuals of the model and help check out some diagnostics of the model fit.\n\nTo plot the linear regression output, we will create a plot with TN on the x-axis and chl-a on the y-axis using `geom_point` like we ususally do. however, we will also use the function `geom_smooth(method = 'lm')` which adds a 'smoothed' line corresponding to a linear model (that is what the abbrevation 'lm' means). We will pair this with the function `stat_poly_eq` which allows you to also add the statistical output to the plot. You can customize what information you want to show up (equation, listed as `..eq.label..`, r-squared, listed as `..rr.label..`, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(okaro_wide)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  Date       chla_mgm3 TN_gm3 TP_gm3 secchi_m\n  <date>         <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 2015-01-22     23.1   0.900 0.0250    0.850\n2 2015-02-19      1.4   0.37  0.0110    3.42 \n3 2015-03-19      4.40  0.400 0.0170    4.07 \n4 2015-04-16      4.60  0.335 0.0122    6.05 \n5 2015-05-21      5.10  0.583 0.023     7.15 \n6 2015-06-23      4     0.920 0.0595    7.35 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel <- lm(chla_mgm3 ~ TN_gm3, data = okaro_wide)\nsummary(model)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = chla_mgm3 ~ TN_gm3, data = okaro_wide)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-35.058  -7.923   0.629   6.175  61.660 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Remember for a linear regression, our residuals should be normally distributed. We will use the function `shapiro.test` which tests for normality. If the p-value of the Shapiro-Wilk is less than 0.05, that indicates that the variable is *not* normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresid <- resid(model)\nhist(resid)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](R_Tutorial_5_2025_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshapiro.test(resid)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tShapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  resid\nW = 0.9152, p-value = 1.157e-05\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nUh oh, the Shapiro-Wilk test returns a p-value of < 0.05, which means our residuals are not normally distributed and we have violated the assumptions of the linear regression--not good!

For example, is the community composition at one site different from another?\n\nIn our case, we will test to see if the distribution of a given water quality variable is different between lakes or sites. \n\nLet's test to see if the data collected at Okawa Bay in the shallower western bay of lake Rotoiti, is significantly different from data collected at Site 4 in Lake Rotoiti, in the much deeper eastern bay of the lake. This will tell us something about how spatially heterogeneous Lake Rotoiti is.

You can choose whichever water quality variable you'd like to look at. Remember, you will need to start with the `wq` dataframe, select the relevant columns, filter LocationName and Parameter. Then you will pivot_wider (don't forget to make a Date column and remove Unit), rename your columns, and run your statistical test plus a plot! HINT: Samples are not collected on the same date between Rotorua and Rotoiti, so you will need to format your dates as Month-Year (e.g., Jan-2021).

First, we need to filter to just secchi depth data and clean a few things up.
