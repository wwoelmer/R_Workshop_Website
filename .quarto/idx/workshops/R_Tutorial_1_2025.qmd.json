First we will learn how to install packages.\n\n### Installing packages\nPackages provide new functions that can help us do specific actions in R. These will become increasingly useful as you learn more about R!\n\nThe main packages that we will use in this tutorial are:\n\n* __tidyverse__\n* __readxl__\n\nBefore attempting to install these packages, make sure your Primary CRAN Repository is set to:\n\n  * __\"New Zealand [https] - University of Auckland\"__  \n  \nTo check this, click 'Tools' --> 'Global Options' --> 'Packages'.  Click 'Change' if you need to adjust this.\n\nYou can download most packages by clicking on  the 'Install' button on the 'packages' tab in the lower right window pane.  Then in the Install Packages popup, select ‘Repository (CRAN)’ from the ‘Install from’ drop box and type the name of the package you wish to download (e.g., dplyr). \n\nYou can also install packages directly using code.\n```{r, message=FALSE}\ninstall.packages('tidyverse') # typically, R needs things to be in quotes, \n# either '' or \"\" if it is not a recognized object in the environment\ninstall.packages('readxl') \n```\n\n\nOnce all of these packages are installed you can load them using the 'library' function:\n\n```{r, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\n```\n\n### Creating objects\nOne of the main ways that you will interact with R is to create and re-use objects. Let's just creating a few objects ourselves. We did this for an in-person workshop where we counted the number of participants and instructors. However, you can change the code whatever you like! If you're alone, maybe try changing it to the number of doorknobs and windows in your room.\n\n```{r, message=FALSE}\nnum_participants <- 13# insert number of people in the room\n  \nnum_instructors <- 3# insert number of instructors in the room\n  \nparticipant_instructor_ratio <- num_participants/num_instructors\n```\n\n\nVoila! You've created new objects! You should now see the objects in the upper right of your RStudio, in the Environment window.\n\n### Read in data, understand data classes, plot data, create new column\nYou can read in many different file formats into R and each will use their own function (e.g., read.csv, read.table, read_excel). To read in a file, you need to tell R where the file is located, relative to your working directory. To check where R is looking for your files, we will run the following function:\n\n```{r}\ngetwd()\n```\n\nThis function tells you *where* your working directory is located. Since we are using a project, it will be where you put your project on your computer. If you don't use a project, you will need to set a working directory using `setwd()`. NOTE: I DO NOT recommend setting working directories for reproducibility reasons. Projects are the best way to organize your files. But see other resources about this if desired: https://rpubs.com/em_/wdInR\n\nNow let's read in our water quality data\n\n```{r}\nwq <- read.csv('./data/BoP_WQ_formatted.csv') # HINT: hit 'tab' as you're typin the directory to see a list of files in this directory\n```\n\nThe ./ notation means: look in the working directory (that is what the period represents),\nthen in the folder data, then look for a file called BoP_WQ_formatted.csv\n\nNow that we've read in our data, it's best practice to look at it and see if everything looks alright.\n```{r}\nView(wq) # this opens up the dataframe to view, \n# you can also do this by clicking on your dataframe ('wq') in the Environment at right\n```\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n```{r setup, include = FALSE}\n# Set CRAN mirror in R code\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\n```\n\n## Overview\n\nThis introductory lesson is designed to teach you the fundamentals of using RStudio to analyze environmental data.
